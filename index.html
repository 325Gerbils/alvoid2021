                <summary>What should I expect from the Alvord?</summary>
                <p>The Alvord Desert is located 6 hours east of eugene in the four corners area between Oregon, Nevada,
                    Idaho, and california. This lake basin desert landscape hosts the lowest light pollution in the
                    lower 48 states, allowing a darker night
                    sky, with more stars than almost anywhere in the United States. This unique landscape is 12-7 miles
                    of totally empty space framed on all sides by mountains, providing a picturesque location for this
                    festival. During the day the desert
                    reflects the sky and creates mirages everywhere you look, and along with the stars and otherworldly
                    sunsets It is truly in my top five Oregon locations. During the time of our festival the average
                    temperatures range between 70 F during
                    the day and as low as 30 F during the night. The area is also prone to sudden dust storms, but don't
                    let this discourage you, it is a small price to pay for the beauty of this landscape. ( check the
                    packing list to see what we recommend
                    you bring)

                <summary>What are the rules?</summary>
                <p>Rules: The alvord desert is essentially the exact same landscape as black rock city, the location of
                    Burning Man. Due to this we will be following several principles of Burning Man whilst at the
                    festival to foster a similar experience,
                    and view of caretaking each other and the environment. Please see the link below: For those of you
                    familiar with burning mans rules regarding water waste: One difference between the alvord desert and
                    the black rock desert is that the
                    alvord does fill with water later in the winter, so dumping water on the playa is less of a problem.
                    Our goal is to create an awesome experience for all participants. Three full days of fun, friends,
                    and shenanigans. If you would like
                    to extend this invite please reach out to us first, it's most likely a yes, we just want a head
                    count.( Email at the bottom of doc) We are hoping to have a variety of local bands across all genres
                    to come play. (maybe some bigger people
                    to, you'll have to wait and see) Bathrooms: There are no bathrooms on playa. However at the access
                    road there is a one stall bathroom, it isn't a long drive. The ideal situation would be if you have
                    to go to the bathroom, drive yourself,
                    and as many people who need to go as possible. With water not being a huge issue to leave behind,
                    you can bike, board, or walk off into the distance to pee. However our preference would be that we
                    bring containers/portable toilets
                    onto playa for all human waste. These could be packed out with you, or dumped in the bathroom when
                    you do go. (At Burning Man I used a container at night, and it made life vastly easier, even if it's
                    a little gross.)

                <p>There will be gravel road no matter which access road you take. Make sure your vehicle can handle it,
                    and make sure you have plenty of gas. You do not want to be stranded in the Alvord without fuel.
                    There is a paved access road thru private
                    property, and they charge like $5 or 10 for thru passage.
